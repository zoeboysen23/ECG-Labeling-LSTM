# ECG-Labeling-LSTM
In collaboration with Ron Yang, we created a LSTM machine learning model to label ECG signal arrhythmias as signal as either normal, left bundle branch blockage, right bundle branch blockage, premature ventrical contraction, or atrial premature beat using the tensorflow library. The data set comes from the open souce MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
